# Day 41 – Triggers & Matrix Builds

### Task 1: Trigger on Pull Request
1. Create `.github/workflows/pr-check.yml`
2. Trigger it only when a pull request is **opened or updated** against `main`
3. Add a step that prints: `PR check running for branch: <branch name>`
4. Create a new branch, push a commit, and open a PR
5. Watch the workflow run automatically

**Verify:** Does it show up on the PR page? 
 - **`yes`**

2. Set it to run every day at midnight UTC

3. Write in your notes: What is the cron expression for every Monday at 9 AM?
   - *`0 9 * * 1`*

### Task 3: Manual Trigger
1. Create `.github/workflows/manual.yml` with a `workflow_dispatch:` trigger
2. Add an **input** that asks for an `environment` name (staging/production)
3. Print the input value in a step
4. Go to the **Actions** tab → find the workflow → click **Run workflow**

**Verify:** Can you trigger it manually and see your input printed?
 - *yes* i am able to trigger it manually and see my output (output -> production)

### Task 4: Matrix Builds
Create `.github/workflows/matrix.yml` that:
1. Uses a matrix strategy to run the same job across:
   - Python versions: `3.10`, `3.11`, `3.12`
2. Each job installs Python and prints the version
3. Watch all 5 run in parallel

Then extend the matrix to also include 2 operating systems — how many total jobs run now?
